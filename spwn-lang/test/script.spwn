IDEAS:

more referances (in structs etc)

count the amount of returns when parsing (returns in loops should count for 2)
if the macro has one return, dont use compile_and_exec, rather just change the context to that return's context

compile_scope should have a parameter that says if its the defining scope of a macro, and if it reaches the end, do a return
